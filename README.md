# tinysprite

[tinysprite](http://msx.jannone.org/tinysprite/tinysprite.html) is an html
sprite editor written by Rafael Jannone. This is a friendly fork which bundles
tinysprite into a  [tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) app.

## get it

for now, you need to pull from git:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jfhbrook/msx-tinysprite.git
```

## install it

to build tinysprite and put it at `~/.local/bin/msx-tinysprite`, run:

```sh
just install
```

## development setup

to start the dev server, run:

```sh
just start
```

## usage

right now it's the same as vanilla tinysprite, afaik. I plan on kicking the
tires on this in the near future and adding some desktop-specific features if
I find them worthwhile.

## license

the license is GPL v3. read the `LICENSE` file for more details.
