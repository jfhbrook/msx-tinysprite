## save/load to file

I want to add a save button in addition to the clipboard export.

There's actually already a stubbed out procedure/ui for this - search for the
function `saveAll` and you'll see. I commented it out, and it's a little bit
broken. The UI is also a little half-baked - but once it's working we can move
it around.

The deal is likely similar with a load button.
