## save button

I want to add a save button in addition to the clipboard export.

There's actually already a stubbed out procedure/ui for this - search for the
function `saveAll` and you'll see. It just needs to be dusted off, most likely.

## load button

if there's a save button, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a load button
too.
